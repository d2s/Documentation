Logging in RsyncOSX might be switched on/off in user configuration. All log records are listed in table within Logs tab. The log records are by default sorted with most recent log ontop. Log records can be *filtered* by text search by selecting the appropriate column. The direction, ascending or descending, is selected by direction of the arrow.

Log records can be selected for delete as well. To filter a log record select the appropriate column. As an example you might filter logs by date or month and then select all filtered log records for deleting. You are prompted to confirm a deleting of log records.
