RsyncOSX and the menu app RsyncOSXsched are prepared for localization. Default language for both is English.

RsyncOSX is localized to:
- Chinese (Simplified) -  by [StringKe](https://github.com/StringKe)
- German - by [Andre](https://github.com/andre68723)
- French - translated by [crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/rsyncosx)
- Norwegian - by me
- Italian - by [Stefano Steve Cutelle'](https://github.com/stefanocutelle)
- English - the base language of RsyncOSX

Localization is done by utilizing [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/rsyncosx) to translate the xliff files which are imported into Xcode after translating. Xcode then creates the required language strings. [Crowdin is free for open source projects](https://crowdin.com/page/open-source-project-setup-request).

Volunteers are wanted for translating to other languages. Please create an issue if you have possibility to translate. Translating to new languages is mostly a proofreading exercise. [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/rsyncosx) does most of the work and proofreading is last step before importing into code.
