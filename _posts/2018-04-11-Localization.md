From version 5.8.5 is RsyncOSX and the menu app RsyncOSXsched is prepared for localization. For the moment both are localized to English and Norwegian. Volunteers are wanted for translating to other languages (e.g German, French, Spanish). Please create an issue for this if you have possibility to translate.

Translating RsyncOSX is done by utilizing the [Xlifftool](https://github.com/remuslazar/osx-xliff-tool). The tool reads a xliff file for translating, see last image for screenshot of tool. Translating RsyncOSX to a new language is done by spending two or three hours for some days.
