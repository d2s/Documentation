From version > 6.1.0  RsyncOSX and the menu app RsyncOSXsched are prepared for localization. RsyncOSX is translated to Chinese (Simplified), German, Norwegian and French. RsyncOSXsched is translated to German, Norwegian and French. Default language for both is English


[RsyncOSX speaks new languages](https://rsyncosx.github.io/Localization). RsyncOSX is localized to:
- Chinese (Simplified) -  by [StringKe](https://github.com/StringKe)
- German - by [Andre](https://github.com/andre68723), is completed and released as **release candidate**
- French - translated by [crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/rsyncosx), is completed and released as **release candidate**
- Norwegian - by me
- English - by me, the base language of RsyncOSX

Volunteers are wanted for translating to other languages (e.g German, French, Spanish). Please create an issue for this if you have possibility to translate.

Localization is done by utilizing [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/rsyncosx) to translate the xliff files which are imported into Xcode after translating. Xcode then creates the required language strings. [Crowdin is free for open source projects](https://crowdin.com/page/open-source-project-setup-request).

The German translation is work in progress. The Chinese (Simplified) and Norwegian translations are also being updated. A new updated release will be available in January 2020.

Main view in English, Chinese (Simplified), German, Norwegian and French.
