From version 5.8.6 RsyncOSX and the menu app RsyncOSXsched are prepared for localization. RsyncOSX is translated to Chinese (Simplified) and Norwegian, RsyncOSXsched is translated to Norwegian. Default language for both is English

- the Chinese (Simplified) translation by [StringKe](https://github.com/StringKe),
- the Norwegian translation by myself

Volunteers are wanted for translating to other languages (e.g German, French, Spanish). Please create an issue for this if you have possibility to translate.

Translating RsyncOSX is done by utilizing the [Xlifftool](https://github.com/remuslazar/osx-xliff-tool). The tool reads a xliff file for translating, see last image for screenshot of tool. Translating RsyncOSX to a new language is done by spending two or three hours for some days.

Main view in English, Chinese (Simplified) and Norwegian.
