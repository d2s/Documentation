RsyncGUI is a sandboxed macOS app compiled with support for **macOS El Capitan version 10.11 - macOS Mojave version 10.15**. The application is implemented in Swift 5 by using Xcode 11.

Rsync is a file-based synchronization and backup tool. There is no custom solution for the backup archive. You can quit utilizing RsyncGUI (and rsync) at any time and still have access to all synchronized files.

The [App Sandboxing technology](https://developer.apple.com/app-sandboxing/) is a technology for protecting the user for malicious software. To release a macOS app on Apple Mac App Store require the app to execute inside a sandbox. RsyncGUI is an adapted version of [RsyncOSX](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncOSX) to execute inside a sandbox. There are a few limitations compared to RsyncOSX.

## Some words about RsyncGUI

RsyncGUI is not developed to be an easy synchronize and backup tool. The main purpose is to ease the use of `rsync` and synchronize files on your Mac to remote FreeBSD and Linux servers. And of course restore files from remote servers. The UI might also be difficult to understand or complex if you don't know what `rsync` is. It is not required to know `rsync` but it will ease the use and understanding of RsyncGUI. But it is though, possible to use RsyncGUI by just adding a source and remote backup catalog using default parameters.

If your plan is to use RsyncGUI as your main tool for backup of files, please investigate and understand the limits of it. RsyncGUI is quite powerful, but it is might not the primary backup tool for the average user of macOS.

## Old version of rsync

The default version of `rsync` in macOS is old (version 2.6.9, [protocol](https://rsync.samba.org/how-rsync-works.html) version 29). Version [2.6.9](https://download.samba.org/pub/rsync/src/rsync-2.6.9-NEWS) was released in nov 2006. The current release of rsync is version [3.1.3](https://download.samba.org/pub/rsync/src/rsync-3.1.3-NEWS) protocol 31 released 28 January 2018.

Utilizing **snapshots** in RsyncGUI is **not possible** due to bugs in default version version 2.6.9 of rsync in macOS. It is not allowed due to the sandbox to execute an updated and another version of rsync in e.g `/usr/local/bin`. Utilizing **scheduled** task is not implemented in RsyncGUI.

If you need either of them please use [RsyncOSX](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncOSX).
