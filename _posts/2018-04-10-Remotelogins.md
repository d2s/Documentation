There are two ways to setup passwordless logins to a **remote server**. RsyncOSX supports both. It is advised to use the first because the traffic is encrypted and it is considered more secure.

### Encrypted protocol by ssh and ssh-keys

By utilizing `ssh` enables **passwordless** logins to remote servers by ssh private and public key-pair.

Using [ssh-keys](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/SSH_keys) is in general considered more safe than standard password solutions (single factor authentication). ssh-keys is based upon [public-key cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography).

- RsyncOSX can assist you [in setting up passwordless logins](/ssh)
- or you can [enable passwordless logins manually](/PasswordlessLogin)

Rsync transfer data between client and server by tunneling transfer of data in an encrypted ssh tunnel.

### Not encrypted protocol by rsync daemon

There is also possible to setup RsyncOSX utilizing a **rsync daemon** setup for synchronizing files to remote servers.

- this is a special setup and require some [tweaking](/Rsyncdaemon)

Rsync is reading a local file with password information when connecting to the server side rsync daemon. The transfer of data between client and server is **not** encrypted.
