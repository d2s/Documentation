I am using the application on a daily basis and it evolves during my own use. Suggestions for new *features*, *enhancements* and *bug reports* are more than welcome. [Please add an issue](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncOSX/issues) regarding requests or bugs. For more information about signing and notarizing of RsyncOSX see [the notarized info](/Notarized).

## RsyncOSX on macOS Catalina

If you are installing on macOS Catalina and utilize a local version of rsync, execute the `rsync` utility in a terminal window before using RsyncOSX. There is a process of granting access for the `rsync` utility before using it by RsyncOSX. MacOS Catalina will also ask permission for accessing your home catalog first time you start RsyncOSX.

If you also utilize the menu-app (RsyncOSXsched), be aware of you might have to force quit RsyncOSX the first time you start the menu-app. This is because the macOS Catalina ask for permissions when starting the menu-app for the first time and RsyncOSX is not closed automatically when starting the menu-app. This might happen only once first time start on the macOS Catalina.

### Please read this

Is RsyncOSX easy to use or a backup tool for the average user? If you have some understanding of how to use rsync, it is helpful for understand the use of RsyncOSX. If you don't know what rsync is I recommend to read about rsync before commencing use of RsyncOSX.

RsyncOSX is not developed to be an easy synchronize and backup tool. The main purpose is to ease the use of rsync and synchronize files on your Mac to remote FreeBSD and Linux servers. And of course restore files from remote servers. The UX might be difficult to understand if you don't know rsync.

RsyncOSX supports synchronize files and snapshots of files. It is important you understand either what synchronize or snapshot is before using RsyncOSX.

If your plan is to use RsyncOSX as your main tool for backup of files, please investigate and understand the limits of RsyncOSX and rsync. RsyncOSX is quite powerful, but it is might not the primary backup tool for the average user of macOS.

## Next version

I have commenced working on next version. Refactor of the scheduling part is in progress. Cleaning up of code is always important. Development of RsyncOSX started for more than three years ago as a personal project to learn Swift. RsyncOSX today is a mature and stable application. I will continue to develop RsyncOSX in the future to make sure it is stable and available on the latest version of macOS and a few previous versions as well.

If you have any suggestions for enhancements or if you discover bugs, [please report an issue](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncOSX/issues).

The following are included in the release:

- fixed a [bug](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncOSX/issues/1061) in user selected parameters to rsync
- added function for [remove](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncOSX/issues/1059) the "-e ssh" flag, seems to be required if using RsyncOSX and ReadyNAS utilizing rsync daemon on server side



## Version 5.7.1

[Released](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncOSX/releases/tag/v5.7.1) 6 February 2019.

There is fixed one bug causing RsyncOSX to crash if other versions than 2.6.9, 3.1.2 or 3.1.3 of rsync is used. This applies to both local rsync and remote rsync if remote servers is utilized.

The following fixes and enhancements will be part of next release:

- fixed bug if not supported versions of rsync is utilized
- added new plans for deleting snapshots, there is now two plans
	- last: keeps **last** selected day previous months, last selected day this mont and all snapshots this week
	- every: keeps **all** last selected day previous months, every selected day this mont and all snapshots this week
	- selected day in user configuration
- some other minor enhancements as well

This will be the last version compiled and released with current released version of Xcode and Swift. Xcode 10.2 and Swift 5 are out as beta and most likely will be released within some months.

## Version 5.6.2

[Released](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncOSX/releases/tag/v5.6.2) 1 January 2019.

This is a maintenance release: cleanup in code, minor bugfixes and [plan](/Plansnapshots) for snapshots.

## Version 5.6.1

[Released](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncOSX/releases/tag/v5.6.1) 6 December 2018

In this release executing scheduled tasks is **moved** to the [menu app](/Menuapp).

The following changes compared to version 5.5.7 are:
- a lot of cleanup in code (delete of dead code)
- delete code for execution of scheduled tasks, the [menu app](/Menuapp) executes scheduled tasks, add and delete schedules in RsyncOSX
- some enhancements in `restore` and restore defaults to temporary restore catalog if set in user config
- some enhancements in cleaning (deleting) snapshots and log records
- and as always some bugfixes

If both RsyncOSX and RsyncOSXsched (the menu app) is running, RsyncOSX is sending a reload message to the menu app every time there is a change to either a configuration or a schedule. The menu app keeps track of scheduled task in all profiles.

If you are not utilizing scheduled tasks don´t install the RsyncOSXsched app.

**Next release** will include **plans for snapshots**. A plan for snapshot is a template for which snapshots to keep and which to delete.

## Version 5.5.7

Released 22 November 2018.

The following are changes in the release:
- refactor batch tasks
- the userconfig is refactored
- and some minor bugfixes and tweaks (gui)
- the RsyncOSX.app is [notarized](/Notarized)
- in the All profiles tab info about used and available remote storage

Here are some screenshots of what is in this [version](/nextversion).

## Version 5.5.5

Relased 22 Oct 2018.

The following are changes in the release:
- enhanced quick backups
- enhanced copy single files
- enhanced snapshots
- bugfixes

I am not able to predict and test for all possible user interactions. I have tried to smoke out most bugs and make the code as robust as possible. The most common errors are nil pointer errors and not taking care of it if a program variable is not initialized nor has a default value when accessed. I have also tried, by program logic, to verify required input ahead of an action. I believe the last version is robust. RsyncOSX can be minimized during operations and all tasks can be aborted at any time. But there are no guarantee that RsyncOSX will handle all situations.

If RsyncOSX does halt or crash during operation there is no damage to files or deletion of files in the `source`. The `source` is only read during `synchronize` and `snapshot` tasks. And always do a restore to a temporary restore catalog.

## Version 5.5.3

Released 29 September 2018.

- supports macOS Mojave and the new Dark Mode
- no logging, minimum or full logging enable/disable in user config

The primary goal for this release is adding [verify](/Verify) of backups. There are also some other and minor fixes as well.

- new function [verify](/Verify)
- if task is selected in Execute view, only logs for selected task is presented in log view
- fixed preserving sort direction and selection of logs
- in [snapshots](/Snapshots) enter number of snapshots to delete directly
- cleaned up in [copy single files](/CopySingleFiles) and fixed a memory leak
- a new info view showing output from rsync during execution of single tasks

## Version 5.3.9

Released 22 July 2018

- deleting or adding [temporary path restore](/UserConfiguration) catalog is not working properly
	- used in Copy Single files
	- and in new function for full restore

## Version 5.3.7

Released 18 June 2018.

A **bug** in automatic backups is fixed, the bug causes RsyncOSX to crash if reporting more than 1000 files to be transferred. The bug is due to wrong number formatting.

Creating the "restore part" of a task is removed, how to do a full restore is reimplemented. There are also some enhancements in the info part, caching of information, select and delete log records and a better check if menu app is installed.

- [full restore](/Fullrestore)

* compiled with latest version of Xcode, version 9.4 (9F1027a)

## Version 5.3.1

Released 23 April 2018.

Rsync does not support encrypted backups directly. There is another tool `rclone` which does. By utilizing RsyncOSX and [RcloneOSX](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/rcloneosx) to synchronize encrypted backup to **remote servers** running OS as FreeBSD, Linux, Solaris and so on. RsyncOSX executes the `rclone` and `rsync` command line tool in one go. The administration of the rclone part is done in [RcloneOSX](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/rcloneosx).

Please read the documents about [encrypted](/Encrypted) backups.

There is also a new feature [automatic](/Automatic) backups. RsyncOSX does a check if there are data to be transferred or deleted and for those configurations a backup is automatic executed.

## Version 5.2.1

Released 28 March 2018.

The RsyncOSXsched.app is not required to install, it is the [menu app](/Menuapp) for scheduled backups.

Within the dynamic info view a progress bar informs about the progress. There is a `Select` button to select all tasks with changed files compared to backup catalog.

## Version 5.1.1

Released 27 February 2018

- added a [menu app](/Menuapp)
to execute scheduled backups, the `menu app`is a minimal version of RsyncOSX only capable of executing scheduled tasks
	- all editing of tasks and schedules are within RsyncOSX
- added notifications when scheduled task is completed
- the scheduled part is redesigned, to activate a schedule select start date and time and type of schedule.

- enhancements in Quick Backup
	-	selecting the i-button checks and estimates the number of changed files compared to the remote storage
	- select which tasks to be executed and press the play button for executing tasks immidialaty
	- the progress of each task is presented (require an estimate first - the i-button)
- some minor cleanup in the schedule part

## Version 4.9.6

- released 9 January 2018
- a couple of minor bugfixes
	- in logging
	- in the ssh-tab for assisting setup of password less logins, when port number in use there is a bug, thx to [pierre-fromager](https://github.com/pierre-fromager) reporting the bug
	- bug in copy files when ssh port in use

	- the log function appends new logs, be careful not logging all actions
- fixed some other minor glitches
- added number of days since last backup in Execute view

## Version 4.8.2

* released 15 Nov 2017
* it is minor maintenance release, a couple of bugfixes and enhancements in batchview

## Version 4.8.1

* released 7 Nov 2017
* this will be the last release for RsyncOSX for some time

The main focus in the version 4.8.1 is UX-design (user experience). The objective is to make the UX-experience in RsyncOSX as good as possible.
## Version 4.8.0

* released 25 Oct 2017
* redesigned the schedules part
* fixed a major bug in batch mode
	- hiding view in batch mode previous versions of RsyncOSX will reset the batch task
	- there are no risk for damaging files, just restart batch task and rsync(OSX) continues from where it stopped
* some other bug fixes as well
* the .dmg file is built on a mounted NOT APFS (SMB mount) filesystem to avoid problems mounting the .dmg file on non APFS systems


## Version 4.7.5

* released 12 Oct 2017
* fixed bug in batch function

## Version 4.7.0

*Caution : there is a bug in the batch function, working on a new release.*

In version 4.5.1, configurations and schedules are kept in memory utilizing singeltons. In version 4.7.0 singeltons are replaced by dynamic objects. This results in cleaner code, less couplings and less housekeeping. Stateful objects are difficult and increases complexity in the code.

* released 10 Oct 2017
* major refactor of several parts (eliminating singeltons)
* changed how to get list of remote files (in Copy Files)
* changed how output from rsync executes and information from rsync output is collected
	- all the analysis on the output is done after a process termination is observed
	- in batch mode calling next task after a 1.0 second stop, if not a process termination might be observed before output from task is completed
* fixed a bug in batchview if rsync discover an error, now rsync aborts and close batchview and notifies about the rsync error
* fixed a bug in setting user selected parameters to rsync (the two first parameters)
* and fixed other minor bugs as well

## Version 4.5.1

Built with Xcode 9 GM.

There is a rsync-3.1.2.dmg included which is a built version of latest rsync. To install this version of rsync please make a catalog in your home directory (or use /usr/local/bin) and make RsyncOSX aware of using the new rsync in [userconfig](/UserConfiguration).

* released 13 Sept 2017
* using [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) has caused several and major rewrites in parts of code
	* some of the classes are yet not adapted to SwiftLint rules
* code is adapted to Swift 4
* fixed a bug when choosing task for batch, an `execute` of task might accidentally start when select or deselect batch task
* fixed a bug in discover new version of RsyncOSX
* there are numerous internal changes and quite a few minor bugfixes
* refactor filter (search) functions in logs and copy files
* fixed a bug causing RsyncOSX to crash if loading new profile during a test for TCP connections
* added parameter `--max-delete=-1` to secure no execution of task if files will be deleted during run (user selected in setting rsync parameters)

## Version 4.4.6

* released 3 July 2017
* rewrite of code for executing single and batch tasks, reduces the complexity and size of code and it separates the view and model
* fixed a bug in Schedules some other minor bugs
* removed test for TCP connections remote servers to a button in Execute view (no automatic check for connections)


## Version 4.4.0

* released 8 June 2017
	* compiled with latest release 8.3.3 of Xcode (which was released June 2017)
* Seems like the [logging](/Logging) problem is partly solved in 30 May 2017 update
* Added Abort when real task is executing
* Refactor of Copy Single files/directory
	* in userconfig set temporary restore catalog (for single files or directory)
	* display size remote files
	* double click on row to get remote filelist
	* double click on row to restore files or directory to temporary (local) catalog
* Clean up of other parts of code

## Version 4.3.0

* released 8 May 2017
* assist in setup of [passwordless logins](/PasswordlessLogin)
	* see [doc](/ssh) - documentation in progress
* couple of bugfixes

## Version 4.2.5

**Bug** in version 4.2.5 causes RsyncOSX to crash if RsyncOSX is minimized during execution of a task. Bug is fixed and will be released in version 4.3.0.

**Next** release (version 4.3.0) will probably include some functionality for assisting setup of [passwordless logins](/PasswordlessLogin). Don't know when it will be released. Summer is coming and further development of RsyncOSX will be slowed down during summer. I am currently working on this release now and (slowly) progressing...

* released 23 Apr 2017
* minor bugfixes and cleanup of code
* compiled with new release of Xcode (version 8.3.2)
* adjusted the parameters to rsync
* adjusted the schedule

In the parameter to rsync, if `backup` option is selected RsyncOSX adds the directory to the backup catalog (for saving changed and deleted files). Choose either suffix for FreeBSD or Linux. Neither of them works on **local backup** macOS (have to test more). But, if you copy and paste the FreeBSD suffix in a terminal window it works on macOS (it adds the correct timestamp to the changed files in the backup directory).

The schedule now informs if a scheduled backup plan is to short ahead. A weekly backup must be at least seven days ahead of current date and time.

## Version 4.2.0

* released 10 April 2017
* compiled with new release of Xcode (version 8.3.1)
* enhanced the batchwork part
* fixed a couple of minor bugs
* some cleanup in code
* reorganized Help
* there is an issue when RsyncOSX counts files to be transferred in *batchmode*, the issue does not introduce any faults (informal only)
* there is also an issue when RsyncOSX is logging, sometimes RsyncOSX does log 0 files and not the actual number of files and size of transfer (informal only)

## Version 4.1.0

* released 19 March 2017
* fixed one bug in parameters to rsync (causing RsyncOSX to crash)
* new help function - opens relevant html page in browser
* added new info using rsync version 3.1.2 (number of *new* and *delete* files)
	* see user configuration how set other version of rsync

## Version 4.0.0

* released 8 March 2017
* new application icon by Forrest Walter (this is the primary reason why releasing a new version)
* added new functionality in `Copy files` - double click on source get list of files from remote server

## Version 3.9.7

Sometimes rsync throws errors and does not execute as expected. Single task is implemented as queue of work (`estimate`, `execute` and `done`). If `estimate` or `execute` fails (by some reason) the user has to be made aware of situation and fix it.

RsyncOSX checks output from rsync for string *rsync error:*. If found Execute view is notified, error is marked (in red) and work queue is reset if option in userconfig (see below) is set. To test enter a not valid user name for a remote server ([edit task](/SingleTask) in Execute view).

Other changes:

- released 2 March 2017
- some refactor and several cleanup of code
- Added reporting any file errors (in profile) to Execute view.
- There is also fixed a minor bug in Profiles.
- In About menu reference to GitHub Pages about Changelog and Documentation of RsyncOSX

## Version 3.9.5

Version 3.9.5 might **crash** for some user. This is due to localized string representation of dates in logs. RsyncOSX only accepts `en_US` format of dates in logs. Comparing and sorting other localized string representation of dates causes a crash.

If RsyncOSX crash during startup please delete the schedule and loggfile: `Documents/Rsync/MacID/scheduleRsync.plist` (deleting this file only deletes any schedule and logs).


- released 28 January 2017
- I´m not adding any major new functionality to RsyncOSX, only minor enhancements.
- the focus in this release candidate is to make logs more informal and stable
- logs are now sorted with most recent log on top (first row in table)
- active schedules are marked red
	- number of logs in each schedule
	- manual execution of tasks are logged under start date `1 Jan 1900 00:00`
- dates are forced to "en_US" localization to prevent RsyncOSX from crashing if the preferred language of macOS is other than english (e.g. Norwegian)

## Version 3.9.1
- released 19 January 2017
- added a few tweaks regarding radio buttons in Execute view and deselect row after delete actions
- moved Add button new configurations into tab view and added some more checks when adding new configurations
- In Sch

## Version 3.8.6
After releasing this version I will not release new versions for some time. I have to focus on my new job (start 2 January 2017) for some time. I will continue to develop RsyncOSX in the future, but the number of new releases will drop compared to 2016.
