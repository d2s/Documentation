Rclone is **rsync for cloud storage**. Even if rclone and rsync are somewhat equal they are also in many ways different. RcloneOSX is utilizing rclone for **synchronizing** and **backup** of files to a number of cloud services. RcloneOSX utilizes rclone copy, sync, move and check commands.

The app is signed with my Apple ID developer certificate and [notarized](/Notarized) by Apple.

## macOS Catalina

If you are installing on macOS Catalina, execute the rclone utility in a terminal window before using RcloneOSX. There is a process of granting access for the rclone utility before using it by RcloneOSX. MacOS Catalina will also ask permission for accessing your home catalog first time you start RcloneOSX.

## Development, bugfixes and coming versions of macOS

For the moment there is no active development of RcloneOSX. I will continue to compile, notarize and sign RcloneOSX for new versions of macOS and fix serious bugs. I will also refactor and enhance the code when required. But there will not be any new functions. My main effort in the future is to continue development of RsyncOSX and RsyncGUI.

## Version 1.7.0

[Released](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/rcloneosx/releases/tag/v1.7.0) 7 December 2018.

The **scheduling part is removed** from RcloneOSX. It was based upon an previous version of scheduling in [RsyncOSX](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncOSX). The scheduling in RsyncOSX is moved to a [menu app](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncOSXsched) and I am not able to do so for the RcloneOSX. The scheduling was not working as it should in RcloneOSX and I don´t have time to develop it further. That is the main reason for removing it in RcloneOSX.

There is a new version 1.45 of rclone. If you are using version 1.45 of rclone you should download this version to get correct info about number of files to synchronize. There was a change in output from version 1.43 of rclone. This is set in userconfig of RcloneOSX.

- a lot of cleanup in code (delete of dead code)
- in user config tick of for version 1.43 of rclone for utilizing rclone versions => 1.43
- some enhancements in restore, restore defaults to temporary restore catalog if set
- estimating remote numbers and size are now included in quick backup
- fixed a bug in batch and some other bug fixes as well
- remove of scheduling

	task by shortcut seems to be more effective compared execute by batch and single tasks

## version 0.2.5

* released 19 Nov 2017
* restore files and catalogs from cloud services
* minor bugfixes
* problem with logging is *probably* solved

## version 0.2.0

* new app icon and a few more bugfixes...
* enhancements in batchview

## Next version 0.1.5

* released 13 Nov 2017
* color rows in main table (check task in blue and move tasks in red)
* initial statistics and numbers are working
* only tasks sync, copy and move adding logs

## Version 0.0.3

* released 11 Nov 2017
* fixed a couple of bugs
* added command check
* only syncand copy tasks allowed executing in batch and by schedule
  - command move may cause some unwanted effects when executed, always do a --dry-run before executing
  - executing single tasks is always a two step task, first a --dry-run and then the real task after inspecting the result of the --dry-run task

## Version 0.0.2

* released 10 Nov 2017
* more fixes and enhancements, all commands as copy, sync and move are implemented
* still alfa release, but most functions work
* still work to do regarding numbers and statistics

## Version 0.0.1

By a couple of hours work with RcloneOSX I managed to do a rclone copy of a local directory to remote directory at Dropbox and Microsoft Onedrive. The Numbers part does not work yet because the output from rclone is quite different compared to rsync. Below are some screenshots from testing.

Adding cloud services is done by using the command line interface rclone config.

### What is working v0.0.1

* only rclone copy
  - verified with Dropbox and Microsoft Onedrive, expect others to work as well
* adding and executing single tasks
* batch tasks
* scheduled tasks
* logging tasks (only date, no numbers)
* profile, storing tasks in profiles
* change and delete configurations
* some parameters are working (just a few tests)

### What is not working v0.0.1

* numbers and statistics of transferred data
* for the moment only rclone copy
  - my knowlegde about rclone and its use is growing every day...
* no gui for rclone config
  - don't know if is possible to make a GUI for setting up rclone
  - for the moment investigating this issue is put on hold
