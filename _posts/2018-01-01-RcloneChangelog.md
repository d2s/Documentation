This is the Changelog for RcloneOSX. RcloneOSX is a port of RsyncOSX to utilize `rclone`.

Rclone is *rsync for cloud storage*. Even if `rclone` and `rsync` are somewhat equal they are also in many ways different. RcloneOSX is built upon the ideas from RsyncOSX. But it is not easy to clone all functions in RsyncOSX to RcloneOSX. I spend most of my time developing RsyncOSX. From time to time some of the functions are ported to RcloneOSX from RsyncOSX.

I am not an advanced user of `rclone`. My main use of RcloneOSX is  synchronizing my GitHub catalog to Dropbox and Google. I have also implemented [encrypted](/Encrypted) backup in RsyncOSX by utilizing RcloneOSX. During this winter (2018/2019) the functions within RcloneOSX will be enhanced. But I need to learn more about rclone before enhancing RcloneOSX.

To get an idea of how RcloneOSX is working please see the [intro](/Intro) to RsyncOSX. The operation and menus are mostly equal. The app is signed with my Apple ID developer certificate and [notarized](/Notarized) by Apple.

## Version 1.8.0 release candidate

## Version 1.7.5

[Released](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/rcloneosx/releases/tag/v1.7.5) 10 February 2019.

Fixed a bug in  copy files.

## Version 1.7.1

[Released](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/rcloneosx/releases/tag/v1.7.1) 1 January 2019.

This is a maintenance release: cleanup in code and minor bugfixes.

## Version 1.7.0

[Released](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/rcloneosx/releases/tag/v1.7.0) 7 December 2018.

The **scheduling part is removed** from RcloneOSX. It was based upon an previous version of scheduling in [RsyncOSX](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncOSX). The scheduling in RsyncOSX is moved to a [menu app](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncOSXsched) and I am not able to do so for the RcloneOSX. The scheduling was not working as it should in RcloneOSX and I don´t have time to develop it further. That is the main reason for removing it in RcloneOSX.

There is a new version 1.45 of rclone. If you are using version 1.45 of rclone you should download this version to get correct info about number of files to synchronize. There was a change in output from version 1.43 of rclone. This is set in userconfig of RcloneOSX.

- a lot of cleanup in code (delete of dead code)
- in user config tick of for `version 1.43 of rclone` for utilizing rclone versions => 1.43
- some enhancements in `restore`, restore defaults to temporary restore catalog if set
- estimating remote numbers and size are now included in quick backup
- fixed a bug in batch and some other bug fixes as well
- remove of scheduling

Scheduling tasks is disabled in this update. Schedules might be setup but it is not effective. Parts of the schedules needs refactor. Schedules will be enabled again when in next release.

- v1.1.5 is updated 10 Dec 2017
- focus on GUI single tasks and batch
- adding several shortcuts
	- after selecting a row the following shortcuts are effective
	- `⌘E` - shortcut for edit task
	- `⌘O` - shortcut for rclone parameters to task
	- `⌘D` - shortcut for delete task
	- `⌘R` - shortcut for immediate execute task, executing
	task by shortcut seems to be more effective compared execute by batch and single tasks
	- `⌘A` - Abort task

If a task is executed by shortcut `⌘R`, a select of another row during execution will terminate (abort) the current task. Scheduled task also might be aborted by selection the stop symbol.

## version 0.2.5

* released 19 Nov 2017
* restore files and catalogs from cloud services
* minor bugfixes
* problem with logging is *probably* solved

## version 0.2.0

* new app icon and a few more bugfixes...
* enhancements in batchview

## Next version 0.1.5

* released 13 Nov 2017
* color rows in main table (`check` task in blue and `move` tasks in red)
* initial statistics and numbers are working
* only tasks `sync`, `copy` and `move` adding logs

## Version 0.0.3

* released 11 Nov 2017
* fixed a couple of bugs
* added command `check`
* only `sync`and `copy` tasks allowed executing in batch and by schedule
  - command `move` may cause some unwanted effects when executed, always do a `--dry-run` before executing
  - executing single tasks is always a two step task, first a `--dry-run` and then the real task after inspecting the result of the `--dry-run` task

## Version 0.0.2

* released 10 Nov 2017
* more fixes and enhancements, all commands as `copy`, `sync` and `move` are implemented
* still alfa release, but most functions work
* still work to do regarding numbers and statistics

## Version 0.0.1

By a couple of hours work with RcloneOSX I managed to do a `rclone copy` of a local directory to remote directory at Dropbox and Microsoft Onedrive. The Numbers part does not work yet because the output from `rclone` is quite different compared to `rsync`. Below are some screenshots from testing.

Adding cloud services is done by using the command line interface `rclone config`.

### What is working v0.0.1

* only `rclone copy`
  - verified with Dropbox and Microsoft Onedrive, expect others to work as well
* adding and executing single tasks
* batch tasks
* scheduled tasks
* logging tasks (only date, no numbers)
* profile, storing tasks in profiles
* change and delete configurations
* some parameters are working (just a few tests)

### What is not working v0.0.1

* numbers and statistics of transferred data
* for the moment only `rclone copy`
  - my knowlegde about rclone and its use is growing every day...
* no gui for `rclone config`
  - don't know if is possible to make a GUI for setting up rclone
  - for the moment investigating this issue is put on hold
