There are som changes to how the ssh part of RsyncOSX is implemented. First of all it is enabled a global, user selected ssh keypath and identity file. If utilized the global values is set in user config. And the global values only applies to tasks with remote servers. The release candidate is as stabel as the released version.

## SSH part

Others changes to the ssh part is only supporting rsa based creation of ssh keypair. The user can of course create a new key and just tell RsyncOSX where the new key is.

A global ssh keypath and identityfile value can be overridden by a local set value. Also applies to SSH port number. Either global er local values are used.

## Monitoring network connection

If enabling monitoring, RsyncOSX monitor the network connection on tasks with remote services. The monitoring is only valid during execution of the task. If there is discovered a network drop an interrupt signal is sent to the active task and it stops with an errormessage (in log).

Monitoring network connection is only valid in macOS 10.14 or later.

In the user configuration ssh keypath, identity file, ssh port and select monitoring on/off are new options.
