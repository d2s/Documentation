All configurations to execute are listed in table. From the Execute view most actions (edit configurations, adding parameters to rsync, delete configurations) regarding configurations are executed.

Configurations can be saved in user selected **profiles**. The profile in use is shown in label `Profile: profilname`. Information about **new or delete** files and **numbers remote** of directories are only available if version 3.x of rsync is used.

### Passwordless logins to remote servers

Using RsyncOSX for backup to **remote servers** require to setup ssh passwordless login. What is ssh passwordless login? By using ssh private and public pair of keys enables a more secure method to login to remote servers without password. RsyncOSX can assist you in setting up [passwordless logins](/ssh)  or you can enable passwordless logins [manually](/PasswordlessLogin).

There is also possible to setup RsyncOSX utilizing a **rsync daemon** setup for synchronizing files to remote servers. This is a special setup and require some [tweaking](/Rsyncdaemon). Rsync is reading a local file with password information when connecting to the server side rsync daemon. 

## Where to start?

You can get up and running in just a few clicks. Open RsyncOSX and select the `Add` tab.

In the `Add` tab, as an example, add the Documents catalog as source and the `/Volumes/backup/Documents` catalog as remote. This will setup a task to synchronize (backup) all content of the Documents to the attached `backup` volume in catalog `Documents`. Use drag and drop from Finder to add data.

Select `Add` button to add task.

## Type of tasks

There are **three** types of how to synchronize source and destination (backup):

(1) **synchronize** source and backup location, any changed and deleted files in backup location will either be overwritten or deleted
  - this is the standard synchronize task in RsyncOSX, after execution source and destination (backup) is 100% in sync if there are no `--exclude` parameters to rsync
  - an `--exclude` parameter instructs rsync to disregard files, catalogs and patterns included in the parameter

(2) **snapshot**  tasks, a [snapshot](/Snapshots) of previous synchronize task is stored before a new task is executed, number of snapshots are user defined, copy deleted or previous versions of files from snapshots

(3) **synchronize** and **save changed** and **deleted** files in a separate backup catalog by adding a [parameters](/Parameters) to rsync

## How to execute any type of tasks

All tasks can be **aborted** at any time by selecting the stop button.

First select **one** task in Execute view, applies to (1) and (2) below.

(1) single task, a **double click** on a task executes first a test run (`--dry-run`), the next double click executes the real run

(2) **`⌘R`** (execute one task now) - shortcut for immediate execute the selected task
- if a task is executed by shortcut `⌘R`, a select of another task during execution will terminate (abort) the current task

(3) **`⌘B`** (execute all tasks now) - shortcut for **automatic executing** backups or by select the double arrow, the command checks tasks for files to be synchronized and automatically executes those tasks

(4) **quick backup**, select the marked arrow button in menu bar

- start with dynamic view of local vs remote storage, automatically selecting tasks with files to be synchronized

(5) mark backup tasks for **batch**, select the marked arrow button in menu bar

- tasks which are marked for batch are selected

(6) **schedule** a task, scheduled tasks are executed according to date and time, either once, daily or weekly

## YouTube videos

There are four short YouTube videos of RsyncOSX:

- [getting](https://youtu.be/MrT8NzdF9dE) RsyncOSX and installing it
  - the video also shows how to create the two local ssh certificates for password less logins to remote server
- adding and executing the [first backup](https://youtu.be/8oe1lKgiDx8)
- doing a full [restore](https://youtu.be/-R6n_8fl6Ls) to a temporary local restore catalogs
- how to change [version of rsync](https://youtu.be/mVFL25-lo6Y) utilized by RsyncOSX
