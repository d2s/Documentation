Before installing and using RsyncOSX there are some important information to read and understand. The first document is how to get and install RsyncOSX. The second document is some information what RsyncOSX is and how to use the application. Please read the second document before using RsyncOSX.

 - (1) [getting and installing RsyncOSX](/Install)
 - (2) [important information](/HowtoUseRsyncOSX) about what RsyncOSX is

Rsync is a file-based synchronization and backup tool. There is no custom solution for the backup archive. You can quit utilizing RsyncOSX (and rsync) at any time and still have access to all synchronized files. Be sure you understand the basics how rsync works before using RsyncOSX. There are also a [changelog](/Changelog) and some info about signing and [notarizing](/Notarized) of RsyncOSX.

```
Caution about RsyncOSX and the `--delete` parameter. The `--delete` is a default parameter.
The parameter instructs rsync to keep the source and destination synchronized (equal).
The parameter instructs rsync to delete all files in the destination which are not present
in the source.

Every time you add a new task to RsyncOSX, execute an estimation run (--dry-run parameter)
and inspect the result before executing a real run. If you by accident  set an empty catalog as
source RsyncOSX will delete all files in the destination.

To save deleted and changes files either utilize snapshots (https://rsyncosx.github.io/Snapshots)
or the `--backup` feature (https://rsyncosx.github.io/Parameters).

The --delete parameter and other default parameters might be deleted if wanted.
```

#### RsyncGUI, a Sandboxed version of RsyncOSX

RsyncOSX is also released as [RsyncGUI](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/rsyncgui/id1449707783?l=nb&ls=1&mt=12) on Apple Mac App Store. RsyncGUI only utilize the stock version of rsync in macOS. Because of that the snapshots feature not available in RsyncGUI. Neither is scheduled backups.

### About restoring files to a temporary restore catalog

If you do a **restore** from the `remote` to the `source`, some files in the source might be deleted. This is due to how rsync works in `synchronize` mode. As a precaution **never** do a restore directly from the `remote` to the `source`, always do a restore to a temporary restore catalog.
