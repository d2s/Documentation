Before installing and using RsyncOSX there are some important information to read and understand. The first document is how to get and install RsyncOSX. The second document is some information what RsyncOSX is and how to use the application. Please read the second document before using RsyncOSX.

 - (1) getting and installing [RsyncOSX](/Install)
 - (2) important [information](/HowtoUseRsyncOSX) about what RsyncOSX is

Rsync is a file-based synchronization and backup tool. There is no custom solution for the backup archive. You can quit utilizing RsyncOSX (and rsync) at any time and still have access to all synchronized files. Be sure you understand the basics how rsync works before using RsyncOSX. There are also a [changelog](/Changelog) and some info about signing and [notarizing](/Notarized) of RsyncOSX.

RsyncOSX is also released as [RsyncGUI](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/rsyncgui/id1449707783?l=nb&ls=1&mt=12) on Apple Mac App Store. RsyncGUI only utilize the stock version of rsync in macOS. Because of that the snapshots feature not available in RsyncGUI. Neither is scheduled backups.

### Passwordless logins to remote servers

Using RsyncOSX for backup to **remote servers** require to setup ssh passwordless login. What is ssh passwordless login? By using ssh private and public pair of keys enables a more secure method to login to remote servers without password. RsyncOSX can assist you in setting up [passwordless logins](/ssh)  or you can enable passwordless logins [manually](/PasswordlessLogin).

There is also possible to setup RsyncOSX utilizing a **rsync daemon** setup for synchronizing files to remote servers. This is a special setup and require some [tweaking](/Rsyncdaemon).

### About bugs and crash?

What happens if bugs occurs during execution of tasks in RsyncOSX? The command line tool `rsync` is designed to continue where rsync is by any reason, stopped or killed. Users can abort execution of tasks at any time. To continue an aborted task execute the task again and rsync will restart and complete the task. This is also true if a bug in RsyncOSX occurs during execution of a task.

If RsyncOSX does halt or crash during operation there is no damage to files or deletion of files in the `source`. The `source` is only read during `synchronize` and `snapshot` tasks.

### About restoring files to a temporary restore catalog

If you do a **restore** from the `remote` to the `source`, some files in the source might be deleted. This is due to how rsync works in `synchronize` mode. As a precaution **never** do a restore directly from the `remote` to the `source`, always do a restore to a temporary restore catalog.
