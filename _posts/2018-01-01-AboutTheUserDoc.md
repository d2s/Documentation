From April 2020 RsyncOSX documentation is [moved to Netlify](https://rsyncosx.netlify.app/). The Jekyll based docs are **also updated**.

The user documentation is built by utilizing [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), the built in support for [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) within Jekyll and the [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) markup language.

GitHub pages generates static html pages of your project at the address `username.github.io`. By utilizing Jekyll you can within minutes setup webpages for your GitHub project. I forked the Jekyll template [Jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now), renamed and moved all the previous user documentation markdown files to the the form `year-month-day-name.md` within the `_post` catalog. And that is basically what is required to get up and running.

I also installed Jekyll on my Mac and can now generate the user documentation on my mac to see how it is before committing the changes to GitHub. GitHub automatically regenerates the webpages when there are new commits.
