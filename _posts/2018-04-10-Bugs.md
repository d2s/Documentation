The command line tool rsync is designed to continue where rsync is by any reason, stopped or killed. Users can abort execution of tasks at any time. To continue an aborted task execute the task again and rsync will restart and complete the task. This is also true if a bug in RsyncOSX occurs during execution of a task.

If RsyncOSX does halt or crash during operation there is no damage to files or deletion of files in the source. The source is only read during synchronize and snapshot tasks.
