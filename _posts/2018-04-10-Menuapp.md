This is the menu app (RsyncOSXsched.app) for executing scheduled tasks in RsyncOSX. Scheduled tasks are added in RsyncOSX. Quit RsyncOSX and let the menu app take care of executing the scheduled tasks. RsyncOSX does **not** execute scheduled tasks. Scheduled tasks are only added and deleted in RsyncOSX.

The menu app can be started from RsyncOSX. If the menu app is installed in **other catalog** than `/Applications`, alternative catalogs has to be set in userconfiguration. The menu app is a simple app with a few screens. The one and only task for the menu app is to execute scheduled RsyncOSX tasks. Every time a task is executed a notification is submitted. If there are tasks waiting for executing there is a green statuslight.

Selecting the Home icon (house) quits the menu app and automatically opens RsyncOSX. The arrow icon executes the selected task now.

The menu app submits a notification when a scheduled tasks are completed. A scheduled task is either of type once, daily or weekly. If there are tasks waiting to execute the status light will be green.
