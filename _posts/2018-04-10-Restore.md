There are two types of restore files:
- Full restore
  - if the remote (destination) is a snapshot the Full restore is from the latest snapshot
- Restore files
  - if the remote (destination) is a snapshot the file list might be huge, depends upon how many snapshots and how many files in a snapshot
  - any file from any snapshot might be restored

Only full restore are allowed to source catalog, but default restore for both Full restore and Restore files is a temporary catalog.
